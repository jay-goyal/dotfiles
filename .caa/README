Client Authentication Agent

Unpack all files into your HOME directory (tar -xzvfp <FILENAME>).
You should have the following files:
<HOME>/.caa/
            ca-cert.pem
            caa.conf
            README
       bin/
            caa
Move the executable (bin/caa) wherever you want and let it be called from within
~/.bash_profile or .profile.

Before initially starting the program, prepare your credentials in the
configuration file caa.conf
The format of the file is:

After the first start of the program, the plaintext password is replaced with
an encrypted version of it.
